# WiFiReboot
## what do it do?
It reboots your WiFi Network adapter. Sometimes it can stuck and won't work properly, so you need to disable and enable it manually so it can work properly again. If it's a WiFi stick you need to unplug and replug it.

Because im a lazy guy i wrote a script for that job.

Enjoy it!
## what language do you use?
Powershell. Clean, easy Powershell.
